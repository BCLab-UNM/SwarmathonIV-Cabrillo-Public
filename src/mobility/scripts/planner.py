        !! avoid_targets and avoid_home shouldn't both be set to True.
           avoid_home will be set to False in this case. !!

        Args:
        * goal - geometry_msgs/Pose2D or geometry_msgs/Point the goal location.
        * tolerance - how close you'd like to get in meters. Could be useful if
          you get a rospy.ServiceException re-raised from this function. The
          function will try 3 times to expand the tolerance by tolerance_step
          from the initial tolerance. But the map/get_plan service may on rare
          occasions still fail to find a path. You can try re-calling with a
          larger initial tolerance in that case.
        * tolerance_step - how much to increment tolerance by if map/get_plan
          fails to find a path.
        * max_attempts - Number of consecutive times the rover can drive or
          turn and receive a MoveResult other than SUCCESS before giving up.
          This is a relatively large number because the first waypoint in a nav
          plan (or the goal itself if not using waypoints) can be 5 or 10
          meters away, and any time the rover comes upon a sonar or tag
          obstacle, its fail_count is incremented. It's not uncommon for the
          rover to come across a scattering of cubes that it must spend some
          time avoiding. During that time, it needs some leeway to drive
          slightly off course as a part of its avoidance behavior. Default
          value of 10 seems to work for the most part.
        * avoid_targets - whether the rover should avoid cubes while driving
          to the goal
        * avoid_home - whether the rover should drive around home tags while
          driving to the goal. Can be used during a search behavior.
        * use_waypoints - whether to use waypoints from searching the map. Can
          be used from the start or as a fallback if the map search fails.
        * start_location - geometry_msgs/Pose2D, the start location of the
          rover. Used by Planner.spiral_search() along with distance_threshold.
          to limit the rover's ability to get way off course while trying to
          get around something like the arena boundary.
        * distance_threshold - the maximum distance the rover's current
          location can be from the start_location before a PathException is
          raised.

        Returns:
        * drive_result - mobility.msg.MoveResult the result of the drive
          command. drive_result == MoveResult.SUCCESS if we reached the goal.
          drive_result == MoveResult.OBSTACLE_HOME if we found a home tag.
          drive_result == MoveResult.OBSTACLE_TAG if we found a cube tag and
          avoid_targets is False.

        Raises:
        * mobility.Swarmie.PathException - if the rover fails more than
          max_attempts times to reach a single waypoint in its current
          navigation plan. Or, if using start_location and distance_threshold,
          if the rover's current location is further than distance_threshold
          from the start_location.
        * rospy.ServiceException - if a path can't be found in 3
          attempts, beginning with initial tolerance and incrementing by
          tolerance_step on each subsequent attempt.
